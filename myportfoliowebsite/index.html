      <h2>My Goals For The Next 2 Years</h2>
      <p>As I continue to grow and evolve as a Software Engineer, I've set a clear roadmap for my professional and personal development over the next two years. Here’s a glimpse into my goals:</p>
      <div class="goals-coll">

        <div class="goals-list card grid-1">
          <h3>1. Master New Technologies and Frameworks</h3>
          <p>The tech landscape is constantly evolving, and I aim to stay ahead of the curve by mastering emerging technologies and frameworks. Over the next two years, I plan to deepen my expertise in modern front-end and back-end technologies, such as React.js, Node.js.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="goals-list card grid-2">
          <h3>2. Expand My Portfolio with Complex Projects</h3>
          <p>To challenge myself and showcase my abilities, I intend to take on more complex and ambitious projects. This could involve building full-stack applications, creating innovative web solutions, or developing tools that solve real-world problems. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="goals-list card grid-3">
          <h3>3. Build a Strong Professional Network</h3>
          <p>Networking is essential for career growth, and I plan to expand my professional connections both online and offline. Attending industry conferences, participating in tech meetups, and engaging with communities on platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn will be a priority. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="goals-list card grid-4">
          <h3>4. Mentor Aspiring Developers</h3>
          <p>Mentorship is a key component of my growth strategy. Over the next two years, I aim to dedicate more time to mentoring aspiring developers. Whether through online platforms, or one-on-one guidance, I want to share my knowledge and experience to help others succeed in the tech industry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="goals-list card grid-5">
          <h3>5. Achieve Work-Life Balance</h3>
          <p>While career growth is important, maintaining a healthy work-life balance is equally crucial. Over the next two years, I will prioritize time management and self-care to ensure that I remain productive and fulfilled in all aspects of my life. This includes setting boundaries, taking breaks, and making time for hobbies and personal interests.</p>
